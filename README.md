Attached are the daily stock prices of two crypto currencies and the apple stock.
We need to create a table to capture the 20 day moving average per year (use 2018 - 2023)
In the final table there should be these columns:
date, year, apple_high, apple_20day_avg, apple_low, bitcoin_high, bitcoin_20day_avg,
bitcoing_low, ethereum_high, ethereum_20day_avg, ethereum_low
Create a power bi line chart showing the 3 moving averages - use year as a filter
1. Please submit the spark code (only java code files)
2. A screenshot of the output table or snapshot of the csv file produced as output
3. Screenshot of the powerbi report (do not send the pbix file)
